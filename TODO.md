# To-do

- Add eslint & Prettier
- Make an interface or abstract class for Praxy?
  - Instead of using the class it self in types
- Make a better algorithm for equality.
- Is there a better way for doing the template replacing in component()?
- Find a way to add types for `$set` usage.
  - So that you can see what data you have access to.
- Clean up the extraction from components data in the constructor.

# DONE
- Tie Praxy together with DOM elements.
