# To-do

- Make a better algorithm for equality.
- Is there a better way for doing the template replacing in component()?
- Make the data of cmpt returned to handler() synced.
    - We might have to pass components to the App intializer, and add it before creating the proxy.
- Find a way to add types for `$set` usage.
  - So that you can see what data you have access to.
- Clean up the extraction from components data in the constructor.

# DONE
- Tie Praxy together with DOM elements.
