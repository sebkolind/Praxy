# To-do

- Make an interface or abstract class for Praxy?
  - Instead of using the class it self in types
- Should the `componentExists` check be done in implementation or the library?
- Make a better algorithm for equality.
- Should set() allow for chaining?
- Is there a better way for doing the template replacing in component()?
- Find a way to add types for `set` usage.
  - So that you can see what data you have access to.

# DONE

- Tie Praxy together with DOM elements.
- Move example stuff out of ./src and rename ./src to ./lib
- Add .nvmrc
- Add eslint & Prettier
- Clean up the extraction from components data in the constructor.
